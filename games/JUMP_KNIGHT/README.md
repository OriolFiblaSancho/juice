# JUMP KNIGHT
**Team Members:** Oriol Fibla Sancho

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Hollow Knight but I want to give more importance to the pogo jump.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The game starts with the player only being able to jump and pogo. As you progress, you unlock additional abilities, 
such as double jumping, dashing, wall jumping or inmortal dash. This progression system keeps the gameplay fresh and rewarding.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players attempt to climb a vertical map with platforms. The game is designed to be challenging, requiring players to use all the 
resources and mechanics at their disposal. If you miss a jump, you fall and lose some progress—sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. 
The objective is to reach the top, though the narrative or motivational reason for doing so is still being developed.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
As mentioned earlier, the more you play, the more mechanics you unlock and master. The difficulty increases as you gain new abilities, 
ensuring the game remains challenging. This progression system also helps mitigate frustration: if you fall and lose progress, 
you’ll still have unlocked mechanics that make it easier to recover and advance. I think that this balance of challenge and reward should keep players engaged.
